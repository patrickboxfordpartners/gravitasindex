      "question": "What is Entity Search and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Entity Search is Google's new way of displaying real estate results. Instead of showing ten blue links to Zillow and Realtor.com, Google will show the home itself—photos, price, details—directly in search results. Next to each listing: the agent's name, response time, and review score. The agents with the fastest response times and strongest reputations will get priority placement. The ones who don't adapt will disappear.",

      "question": "How long does setup take?",
      "answer": "Most implementations are live within 7-10 business days. We handle CRM integration, AI configuration, review automation setup, and Schema implementation. You'll have a dedicated onboarding call to map out your specific workflow, then we execute everything on our end.",

      "question": "Why only 12 agents per market?",
      "answer": "Entity Search rewards first movers. If we onboard 50 agents in Denver, they're competing against each other. We limit capacity to 12 per market so our clients have a structural advantage. Once spots fill, we close applications and open a waitlist.",

What we can't control is your close rate or how fast Google rolls out Entity Search in your specific market. But when it does, you'll be ready. Your competitors won't.",
