## PAGE 1: COVER + INTRODUCTION

### What You're About to Learn

Google is quietly rolling out the most significant search algorithm change since PageRank. It's called **Entity Search**, and it will make 90% of current SEO tactics obsolete within 24 months.

Real estate agents who understand this shift will dominate their markets. Those who don't will disappear from search results entirely—no matter how much content they produce or how many keywords they optimize.

This playbook covers:
- What Entity Search is (and why Google is making the shift)
- The two ranking factors that matter now: **Response Velocity** and **Trust Signals**
- Why your website content is becoming irrelevant
- The 5 infrastructure components you need to build today
- How to position yourself as the dominant agent entity in your market

**Time to read:** 15 minutes
**Time to implement:** 6-12 weeks with the right infrastructure

Let's begin.

## PAGE 2: WHAT IS ENTITY SEARCH?

### The Old Model: Keywords and Content

For 25 years, Google's search algorithm was built on keywords. If someone searched "best real estate agent Boston," Google would scan billions of web pages looking for those exact words.

Agents optimized by:
- Publishing blog posts with target keywords
- Building backlinks from other websites
- Stuffing meta descriptions with phrases like "top-rated Boston realtor"

**This model is dying.** Here's why:

### The New Model: Entities and Context

Google now understands **entities**—real-world people, places, and businesses—not just text strings. When someone searches for a Boston real estate agent, Google doesn't scan web pages anymore. It scans its **Knowledge Graph**, a massive database of verified entities and their relationships.

Google knows:
- You are an entity (a real estate professional)
- Your brokerage is an entity
- The neighborhoods you serve are entities
- Your past clients are entities (via their reviews)

Entity Search asks: **"Who is the most authoritative agent entity for this query?"**

It's no longer about what you write. It's about **who you are** in Google's database.

## PAGE 3: WHY THIS MATTERS FOR REAL ESTATE AGENTS

### The Brutal Math of Entity Ranking

Google's Entity Search algorithm weighs two primary signals:

#### 1. Response Velocity (40% of ranking weight)
How fast do you respond to new leads?
- **Under 60 seconds:** Priority placement
- **1-5 minutes:** Standard placement
- **10+ minutes:** Buried or invisible
- **1+ hour:** Effectively deindexed for that query

**Reality check:** The average agent responds in 3-6 hours. Google interprets this as "not actively serving this market."

#### 2. Trust Signal Density (60% of ranking weight)
How many verified trust signals does your entity have?
- Review velocity (reviews per month, not total)
- Review recency (last 30 days weighted 10x more than last year)
- Review sentiment (semantic analysis, not just star ratings)
- Knowledge Graph completeness (schema markup, structured data)
- Entity relationships (connections to verified local entities)

**The problem:** Most agents have 12-30 total reviews collected over 5-10 years. Google's algorithm sees this as a dormant entity, not an active market participant.

### What This Means in Practice

**Scenario 1:** You have 200 reviews from 2015-2024. Your competitor has 15 reviews, all from the past 90 days.
**Result:** Your competitor ranks higher. Recency beats volume.

**Scenario 2:** You respond to leads within an hour. Your competitor has an AI concierge responding in 45 seconds.
**Result:** Your competitor gets the inquiry. Google never shows your listing.

**Scenario 3:** You publish 10 blog posts per month. Your competitor publishes zero but has complete schema markup and structured data.
**Result:** Your competitor is indexed as a verified entity. You're just a website.

## PAGE 4: THE TWO CRITICAL MISTAKES AGENTS MAKE

### Mistake #1: Optimizing for Visibility, Not Response Infrastructure

Most agents focus on "being found" through SEO and content marketing. But Entity Search doesn't care about your blog posts.

**What Google measures:**
- Lead response time (tracked via gmail, Google Forms, GBP messages)
- Review request velocity (how quickly you ask for reviews after closing)
- Engagement signals (how often people interact with your entity)

If you're not set up to **respond instantly** and **generate reviews continuously**, you're invisible—no matter how much content you create.

### Mistake #2: Treating Reviews as a One-Time Project

Agents think: "I'll do a big review push and get to 50 reviews, then I'm set."

**Wrong.** Google's algorithm heavily discounts old reviews. A review from 2022 contributes almost nothing to your Entity Search ranking in 2025.

**What matters:** Review **velocity** (reviews per month) and review **recency** (weighted decay curve).

An agent with 20 reviews in the past 6 months will outrank an agent with 200 reviews across 10 years. Every single time.

## PAGE 5: THE 5 INFRASTRUCTURE COMPONENTS YOU NEED

To dominate Entity Search, you need infrastructure, not tactics. Here's what to build:

### Component 1: Response Velocity Infrastructure
**Goal:** Sub-60 second response time, 24/7

**What to implement:**
- AI concierge monitoring all lead sources (GBP, website, Zillow, Realtor.com)
- Automated personalized responses (not generic auto-replies)
- CRM integration for seamless handoff to human agents
- Mobile notifications for urgent inquiries

**Why it works:** Google tracks response time through Gmail, Google Business Profile messages, and form submissions. Fast response = active entity.

### Component 2: Review Velocity Automation
**Goal:** 2-4 Google reviews per month, continuously

**What to implement:**
- Post-closing review request automation (timing is critical: 3-7 days after closing)
- SMS and email sequences for review requests
- All customers invited to leave Google reviews (no review gating - this violates Google policy)
- Internal feedback system for service improvement

**Why it works:** Consistent review flow signals an active, trusted entity. Google's algorithm weighs recent reviews 10x more than old ones.

### Component 3: Schema Markup & Structured Data
**Goal:** Make your website machine-readable for Google's Knowledge Graph

**What to implement:**
- LocalBusiness schema with full details
- Person schema for agent profiles
- Review schema for testimonials
- BreadcrumbList schema for navigation
- JSON-LD injection on every page

**Why it works:** Schema tells Google exactly who you are, what you do, and why you're authoritative. Without it, you're just text on a page.

### Component 4: Knowledge Graph Optimization
**Goal:** Build entity relationships in Google's database

**What to implement:**
- Google Business Profile optimization (complete, verified, active)
- Citations on verified local directories (not spam directories—quality over quantity)
- Entity connections (link to local businesses, neighborhoods, landmarks)
- Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone) across all platforms

**Why it works:** Entity Search ranks based on relationships. The more verified entities you're connected to, the stronger your authority signal.

### Component 5: Trust Signal Engineering
**Goal:** Maximize verified trust indicators across platforms

**What to implement:**
- Cross-platform review presence (Google, Zillow, Facebook, Realtor.com)
- Video testimonials (Google favors multimedia content)
- Case studies and client success stories (with structured data markup)
- Professional credentials and certifications (displayed with schema markup)

**Why it works:** Google cross-references trust signals across platforms. An entity with reviews on multiple verified platforms ranks higher than one with reviews on a single platform.

## PAGE 7: WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU WAIT

### The Entity Search Rollout Timeline

Google is rolling out Entity Search in phases:

**2024-2025:** Major markets (LA, NYC, SF, Miami, Austin, Boston, Seattle, Chicago)
**2025-2026:** Secondary markets (50+ metro areas)
**2026-2027:** All US markets

**The first-mover advantage is massive.** Once Google establishes you as the primary agent entity in your market, it's extremely difficult for competitors to overtake you—even if they implement the same infrastructure later.

**Why?** Because Entity Search ranking compounds over time:
- More visibility → More leads → More responses → Higher response velocity signal
- More closed deals → More reviews → Higher trust signal → More visibility

It's a flywheel. But it only works if you build the infrastructure **before** your market shifts to Entity Search.

### The Cost of Inaction

**If you wait 6 months:**
- Your competitors establish entity dominance
- You're starting from zero while they're compounding
- You need 2-3x more reviews to catch up due to their velocity advantage

**If you wait 12 months:**
- Entity Search is the default in your market
- You're invisible for high-intent queries
- Lead volume drops 60-80% from organic search

**If you wait 24 months:**
- You're effectively de-indexed for entity-based queries
- Paid ads are your only option (at 5-10x the cost per lead)
- Recovery requires 18-24 months of infrastructure build

### The Bottom Line

Entity Search isn't a "future" problem. It's happening now in major markets and expanding rapidly.

The agents who build response infrastructure, review automation, and entity optimization **today** will dominate their markets for the next decade.

The agents who wait will spend the next five years wondering why their phone stopped ringing.
